Ant research

Approximate total Ant global population: 10 thousand trillion
Ants are loyal to their colonies and queen

16000 species of ant
Can be found in any continent except Antarctica
Colonial existence and specialized social structure

Colony structure:

Ant societies are broken up into two castes:
Non-reproductive worker caste, reproductive loyal caste

Queen is the only reproductive female of the entire colony and the colony exists to serve her.
A colony begins with the birth of a queen. Queens are born from special eggs laid by the mother queen, which are different than all other regular worker eggs. These eggs are laid after the colony has reached a certain size, and when they hatch they produce larger ants with wings. These ants are reproductive males and female young queens.

During nuptial flights, these winged ants take flight and mate with each other, after which the males die and the queens drop to the ground, scrape off their wings, and look for a place to dig their nests.
Only few queen ants survive, around 1/500 succeed to not get devoured by predators or to find the perfect nest. Those that succeed become the single egg laying ant of a colony. Some species might have more than one queen

Over the course of her life, a queen ant can lay up to 300 million eggs, depending on the species. Majority of these eggs are worker ants. All worker ants are female, and they are devoted to the queen’s welfare and reproductive activity. 

In the average ant colony, two kinds of females exist: those who mate and those who don't. The non-mating females are all daughters of the queen. The non-mating females raise the babies, gather the food, maintain and expand the nest, and look after the queen, who does nothing but lay eggs continuously. 

There are many different types and sizes of worker ants with different roles. Worker ants don’t have wings. The worker ants decide the roles of the larvae, choosing which worker caste they will develop into. Worker ants develop into different types based on their nutrition during their larvae phase. Those fed more insects are more likely to become larger individuals. The variety in sizes is called polymorphism. 

The larger workers are called soldiers they defend the colony. Medium size ants are excavators, foragers, garbage collectors, etc. The smallest ants are gardeners, they fed the young and cultivate and farm fungus, the only food source for the whole colony.

Communication:

Ants behave and travel based on a complex system of communication.
Ants have poor sight and hearing. 
Ant anatomy: Dufour’s gland.
Dufour’s gland is located inside an ant’s abdomen. This gland holds and releases different types of pheromones which ants use to communicate. Ants tap their abdomen to the ground leaving trails of pheromones. Scientists have found over 20 different types of pheromones for communication.
Along with pheromones and signals (physical gestures) ants created a complex pheromonal language.
Communication in general has allowed ants the capacity to work together.

Superorganism
Worker ants die young, and don’t create offspring. They have no self interest.
On average foragers survive for only a week, but she manages to collect up to 20 times her weight in food for the colony, all to support the group and queen.
Once a queen die, in most cases and species of ants, the colony fails to produce a royal successor, and it declines until the last worker dies.
