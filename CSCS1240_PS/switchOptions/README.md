# Switch Options Information

The objective of this task was to use a **switch case statement** and analyze its functionality.
This is a very short and simple program, yet I tried to keep it very *organized and structured*.
I remember that some classmates were struggling to understand the general logic of switch-case statements, and therefore I decided to include some narrative aspects into it.
Kids these days understand code and logic better when explained to them in a video game fashion.

I will describe in general terms the functionality of the script, and I would like to encourage you to **take a look at the code or even run the code** for a better understanding of what it does; it is very concise and clear.

### Functionality:
  - This program prints a welcome message explaining its functionality and then proceeds to ask for user input.
  - Then the input is checked to make sure it is valid. Otherwise, the input is looped until it gets what it wants.
  - There are only 4 switch cases available, and whenever any of them is true, the script prints the corresponding message and exits.
