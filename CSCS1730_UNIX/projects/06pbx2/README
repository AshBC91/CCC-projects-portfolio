=========
Welcome to the next thrilling project in the puzzle box series! As it was
before, a piece of data has been contorted and obfuscated, and requires a
keen, observing eye to suss out, unravel, and piece it back together in a
coherent, vieable form.

Some files in  the zip archive are password protected.  One such password
can  be extracted  automatically from  this document  by grepping  it for
'^PASSWORD:',  and  capturing only  the  content  AFTER  the colon  in  a
variable (that  you can then use  with other commands in  your automation
efforts).

PASSWORD:UYH1sPCoPkVX

Obtain the  password and figure out  how to extract what  data it unlocks
from the archive and investigate it.

Analyze  it;  this  data  is encoded  somehow.  Determine  the  potential
patterns that may  govern it, and explore different ways  of decoding it.
There may  be several  layers, manipulations, pieces,  etc. that  need to
be obtained  and eventully  extracted/decoded/deciphered/arranged/etc. to
build your final result.

As you go  along, apply your senses of pattern  matching to unjumble what
you have gotten. As always- avoid manual work: use tools on the system to
help you. You  will be again making  a steps file that should  be able to
automate the process, carrying out the non-interactive commands making up
the steps of your solving process. This file shall be called "pbx2steps",
and  you  submit it  at  the  conclusion of  your  work  on the  project,
along  with  the  fully  unravelled  product (stored  in  a  file  called
"pbx2.results").

If you execute this script (your steps file), it should non-interactively
carry out the  unravelling process (assuming the files  have been already
copied into  the current directory),  and produce the end  result without
any errors generated.
