# Class Housing Information

This script was the final project of the semester. At this point, we were lastly introduced to Classes, Objects, and Inheritance. For this project, I decided to create a program that worked as a directory, similar to the Yellow Pages, where I modeled different addresses, each describing the type of housing and the characteristics of each home.
