# Most commands are executed directly @lab46, unless otherwise specified.
# Too obvious or repeated commands will no have descriptive comments.

# Starting home ~.
00. $ cd ~/src/spring2022
01. $ mkdir pbx1
02. $ cd pbx1
03. $ cp /var/public/spring2022/unix/pbx1/abarbcal/{pbx1.ogg, README} .
# Copied pbx1.ogg, REAME files to current directory.
04. $ mkdir ogs
# Created ogs directory, to store original files.
05. $ cp pbx1.ogg ogs/
# Made backup copy.
06. $ bunzip2 pbx1.ogg
# Obtained pbx1.ogg.out.
07. $ ar -x pbx1.ogg.out
# Extracted data with ar. Obtained datafile.
08. $ mv datafile ogs
09. $ cp ogs/datafile .
# Made backup copy.
# Analyzing file:
10. $ wc -l datafile
10a. $ cat -n datafile
# 27 lines long - 1 line of X = 26 / 2 = 13.
11. $ wc -L datafile
# 59 characters -1 space = 58 columns / 2 = 29 - 1 = 28.
# Each corner of the image is 13 lines long and 28 columns wide.
# Columns: Last character before X has position 28. First character after X has position 30.
# Lines: Last line before X has position 13. First line after X has position 15.
12. $ tail -13 datafile > pbx1.bottom
# Getting bottom half of image.
13. $ head -13 datafile > pbx1.top
# Getting top half of image.
14. $ cut -c 30- pbx1.top > pbx1.Q2
# Getting right half from file, which is the top-left portion of image.
15. $ cut -c 1-28 pbx1.top > pbx1.Q1
# Getting left half from file, which is the top-right portion of image.
16. $ paste -d '' pbx1.Q2 pbx1.Q1 > pbx1wip
# Merging files with parallel lines, no delimiter, to complete top half of image.
17. $ cut -c 30- pbx1.bottom > pbx1.Q3
# Getting right half from file, which is bottom-left portion of image.
18. $ cut -c 1-28 pbx1.bottom > pbx1.Q4
# Gerring left half from file, which is bottom-right portion of image.
20. $ paste -d '' pbx1.Q3 pbx1.Q4 >> pbx1wip
# Merging files with parallel lines, no delimiter, to complete the entire image.
21. $ mv pbx1.* ogs/
# Moved all extra pbx1.* files to ogs directory.
21. $ mv pbx1wip pbx1.results
22. $ filechk unix pbx1
# md5sums matched :).
23. $ submit unix pbx1 pbx1.results pbx1steps
