# Brainstorming

1. Have a class called **Formicidae (or Ants)**
2. Have a class called **species**
    - Although there are different subfamilies, genera, and subgenera, I will be skipping straight into species.
    - There are around 14000 different species of ants. For the initial iteration of this program I will be focusing only on one (possibly three) species, but set-up for possible expansion.
    - Depending on the species, the properties for allometry and castes vary.
3. Have a class called Camponotus pennsylvanicus ( or Black Carpenter)
    - Camponotus polymorphism encompasses four distinct forms of allometry, ranging from monophasic allometry, to complete dimorphism.
    - The most common are monophasic (bimodal) and triphasic. I will be focusing on triphasic.
    - Allometry dictates the different sizes between the castes and subcastes
    - Triphasic allometry indicates that three distinct sizes of worker ants: minor, medias, and majors.
    - Black carpenter ants are monogynous, only one queen per colony.
4. Have a class called **brood**
    - Brood consists of 4 stages (methods), egg, larvae, pupa, and adult
    - An ant could take from 6 – 10 weeks to develop (or up to 60 days)
    - Egg stage, eggs hatch in a period of one to two weeks (7-14 days)
    - Larvae stage, larva grow rapidly developing into pupae in 6 – 12 days
    - Pupae stage, final gestation period takes 6-10 weeks (9 – 30 days most species)
    - Pupa emerge as an adult. New ants are called nanitics, they are paler and transparent.
    - Ant’s sex and castes are mostly determined by nutrition and genetics.
5. Have a class called **sex**
    - Females are diploid (two sets of chromosomes), hatched from fertilized eggs.
    - Females are haploid (one set of chromosomes), hatched from one unfertilized eggs.
6. Have a class called **castes**
    - Castes and subcastes depend on how much nutrition the larvae receive during development
        - A starved larvae hatches into workers
        - A well fed larvae hatches to Queen
        - The other castes and subcastes fall in-between these two.
    - Depending on nutrition, pupation could be pre-matured or prolonged
    - Worker<Male<Queen
    - Minors<Medias<Majors/Soldiers<Males<Queen
7. Have a class called ** Queen (or gyne)**
    - Queens could live up to 15 years
    - Queen ants are alate/dealate
8. Have a subqueen class called **Ergatoid (helper Queen)**
    - Queens that have no wings, they remain virgin and function as laborers
9. Have a class called **Workers (or ergates)**
    - Workers could live 4-5 years
    - Roles depend on size and age.
    - Younger ants are nurses and they tend to not leave the colony.
    - Young-adult ants are Queen Attendants.
    - Middle-age ants are foragers and maintain the nest. Tend to start leaving the colony
    - Elder ants serve as foragers, nest builders, soldiers, and transporters.
10. Have a subcaste called **Minor**
    - Gardener, nurses, foragers
11. Have a subcaste called **Media**
    - Are excavators, foragers, garbage collectors
12. Have a subcaste called **Majors**
    - Majors could be workers and soldiers. Not all major workers are soldiers.
    - Soldiers defend the colony.
    - Major workers serve as protein foragers and “tankers”, as they could carry heavier loads.
13. Have a class called **Males (or drones)**
    - Males have neither roles nor tasks within a colony, their purpose is to reproduce and then die one hour after mating.
