PuzzleBox (pbx1)
================
Once again, your skills are put to the test; you are given a data file
that contains a scrambled ASCII art image that you must unravel and 
re-assemble, using only non-interactive command-line tools (no text
editors! no assistive scripts you didn't write!)

The final "image" can be identified by a top and bottom row of the 
uppercase and lowercase vowels of the alphabet. Top row will be the
uppercase vowels, bottom row the lowercase.

The left and right-most columns contain a sequential line count, 
ranging from 000 to 031 in octal.

The flow of data is counter-clockwise: it will increment top to
bottom along the left margin, increment left to right along the
bottom margin, increment bottom to top along the right margin, and
then increment right to left along the top margin.

Keep track of your steps, and place them in a working non-interactive
script by the name of "pbx1steps", which you will submit along with
your final ASCII art image, stored in a file called: "pbx1.results"
