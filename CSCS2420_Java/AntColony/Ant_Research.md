Colonial existence and specialized social structure

Colony structure:
Ant societies are broken up into two castes:
Non-reproductive worker caste, reproductive loyal caste

Queen is the only reproductive female of the entire colony and the colony exists to serve her.
A colony begins with the birth of a queen. Queens are born from special eggs laid by the mother queen, which are different than all other regular worker eggs. These eggs are laid after the colony has reached a certain size, and when they hatch they produce larger ants with wings. These ants are reproductive males and female young queens.

Colonies could be monogynous or polygynous. Monogynyous one Queen, polygynyous multiple Queens.

During nuptial flights, these winged ants take flight and mate with each other, after which the males die and the queens drop to the ground, scrape off their wings, and look for a place to dig their nests.
Only few queen ants survive, around 1/500 succeed to not get devoured by predators or to find the perfect nest. Those that succeed become the single egg laying ant of a colony. Some species might have more than one queen

Over the course of her life, a queen ant can lay up to 300 million eggs, depending on the species. Majority of these eggs are worker ants. All worker ants are female, and they are devoted to the queen’s welfare and reproductive activity. 

In the average ant colony, two kinds of females exist: those who mate and those who don't. The non-mating females are all daughters of the queen. The non-mating females raise the babies, gather the food, maintain and expand the nest, and look after the queen, who does nothing but lay eggs continuously. 

There are many different types and sizes of worker ants with different roles. Worker ants don’t have wings. The worker ants decide the roles of the larvae, choosing which worker caste they will develop into. Worker ants develop into different types based on their nutrition during their larvae phase. Those fed more insects are more likely to become larger individuals. The variety in sizes is called polymorphism. 

The larger workers are called soldiers they defend the colony. Medium size ants are excavators, foragers, garbage collectors, etc. The smallest ants are gardeners, they fed the young and cultivate and farm fungus, the only food source for the whole colony.
Communication:
Ants behave and travel based on a complex system of communication.
Ants have poor sight and hearing. 
Ant anatomy: Dufour’s gland.
Dufour’s gland is located inside an ant’s abdomen. This gland holds and releases different types of pheromones which ants use to communicate. Ants tap their abdomen to the ground leaving trails of pheromones. Scientists have found over 20 different types of pheromones for communication.
Along with pheromones and signals (physical gestures) ants created a complex pheromonal language.
Communication in general has allowed ants the capacity to work together.

Superorganism
Worker ants die young, and don’t create offspring. They have no self interest.
On average foragers survive for only a week, but she manages to collect up to 20 times her weight in food for the colony, all to support the group and queen.
Once a queen die, in most cases and species of ants, the colony fails to produce a royal successor and it declines until the last worker dies. 

Ant colonies operate in social structures akin to hierarchies. This means that certain ants have a superior role to other ants in the colony.
Queens
Drones
Workers
Reproductives

Reproductive Ants
Sometimes, the queen will lay eggs that hatch into winged ants. These ants can be both male and female, and their purpose is to leave the nest and establish new colonies. The males die soon after mating with the females, while some of the female ants survive to become queens of their own colonies.

Drone Ants
Drone ants have one function and one function only: to reproduce with the queen. Drones are male ants that rarely leave the colony. They die after mating with the queen.
Males
Much like the queens, males have large wings and a larger bodies than the worker ants. The difference in body type from the queen is that the males’ abdomens are quite slender. They also have flaps underneath belonging to their sexual organs. These are always visible even though they might be hard for us to spot.

The males are born in the nest and after birth start wandering around it. Most of the time, they do not perform any of the colony duties, but rather bides their time waiting for the nuptial flights. Their mission in life is not to contribute to the colony, but to mate with as many females as possible. When the big day comes the males dies off within the hour after mating. If they’re lucky they can survive for a few days. But unfortunately, in the ant world, there is no life for a male ant after mating. By then, the females are either dead or beneath the ground, founding their new colonies. The males cannot survive another year in the hopes of a new generation of females taking flight. (2)

Males are almost always darkly colored, independent of other castes color schemes. This makes it very difficult to tell their species, because many males look the same. (3)

Ant behavior:
Ant colonies fight among each other.
Ants hibernate. After winter is over, centuries check if weather conditions are warmer.
Right after hibernation, the queen lays new eggs. The first eggs will contain winged queens and males.
Worker ants feed and care for them, as they will have to be ready to mate once spring arrives.

Once the ice melts, foragers travel around, and when they meet ants from other colonies they engage in fights. Ants tend to request for backup and fight to gain territory. Wars among ant armies.

Wood ants spray formic acid from their abdomens against enemies and predators.
Ants bite and pull from ant enemy’s antennae and limbs. It could take up to 7 ants to subdue one enemy. 6 ants hold down from the extremities, while the seventh uses its mandibles to cut open parts of the enemy ant’s exoskeleton exposing the insides.

Once the exoskeleton is ripped apart, the attacker ant squirts acid into the wound, to dissolve the inner organs.

Ant colonies identify each other with chemical “badges”, a scent particular to their colonies. Ants tap their antennae against other ants to find out if they’re friend or foe.

These wars can continue for over a week, and thousands of ants die. The victors will gain territory and keep the dead enemies as food.

Females are diploid, hatched from fertilized eggs, hence two sets of chromosomes
Males are haploid, hatched from unfertilized eggs, hence just one set of chromosomes from the mother, thus males do not have a father

•	Queens: reproductive females that are fully winged (alate) in most species but can be short-winged or wingless in other species. According to species, one or several mated queens reproduce in a colony. They have a lifespan of up to 25 years (and even more in the laboratory). Queens are dealate after mating.
•	Workers: non-reproductive (sterile) females that are always wingless. They form the bulk of individuals within a colony, and typically live one or a few years. In a proportion of species, virgin workers can lay haploid eggs (destined to be males) in orphaned colonies. Several genera have workers that completely lack ovaries.
•	Males: fully winged (mostly), short-winged or wingless (in a few species). They are generally present within a colony for only a short time each year and typically live a few weeks, dying very soon after mating.

There are three terminologies used to differentiate between the casts, gyne for queen, ergates for workers, and aner for males; the aner terminology is no longer in use.

Queens (gyne):
•	Winged/alate
o	According to a morphological definition of castes, any alate or dealate (after mating) female with fully segmented flight thorax, regardless of its reproductive status.
o	According to a functional definition of castes, any mated and egg-laying female of an ant colony.
•	Ergatoid (flightless)
o	Queens that emerge as adults without wings. As a result of the lack of wing muscles, the thorax is reduced and worker-like. However, reproductive organs are fully functional and allow sexual reproduction. Can co-occur with winged queens in species where independent colony foundation alternates with colony fission
	'Single-purpose': Few are produced in each colony, they are larger than workers and function exclusively for reproduction
	'Multi-purpose': Many are produced in each colony, they are similar in size to workers, only one or few mate and reproduce while others remain virgin and function as laborers.
•	Dichthadiiform (flightless)
o	The special form of ergatoid queen peculiar to army ants, with a very large gaster to accommodate massive egg production. Winged queens do not exist in army ants.
•	Brachypterous (short-winged, flightless)
o	Queens that emerge as adults with short non-functional wings.

Workers (ergates):
Many species have a monomorphic worker caste, with all individuals approximately the same body size and shape. Other species have polymorphic workers that show more or less continuous variation in body size. These can be divided into a number of subcastes based on distinct size differences. Dimorphic species have two distinct size classes, either called "minor" and "major", or "worker" and "soldier".

Worker subcastes
Depending on the ant species, there are different categories for polymorphism.
•	Monomorphism: all ants are approximately the same size, no distinctions.
•	Monophasic allometry: Ants sizes are distinguishable, but they overlap, and hence the majors and minors are connected by intermediate-sized workers, or “medias.”
•	Diphasic allometry: Diphasic allometry permits the stabilization of the body form in the small caste while providing for the production of a markedly divergent major caste by means of a relatively small increase in size. In other words, it is very clear the difference in sizes between majors and minors. Minors are constant in small size, while majors are large but not constant.
•	Triphasic and tetraphasic allometry: There is a distinction between minors, medias, and majors.
•	Complete dimorphism: Two morphologically very distinct size groups exist, separated by a gap in which no intermediates occur.
Many of the polymorphic and dimorphic species show allometry. That is, the heads and mandibles of the large, or major, workers are disproportionally large when compared to those of the small, or minor, workers.
The workers are the most commonly seen caste, especially as they forage on the surface of the ground or when they are disturbed under rocks or other objects. However, in most species not all workers forage outside of the nest. Ants show a strong division of labour, where different workers perform different tasks within the nest, and in some cases the specific tasks undertaken will depend on the age of the ant.

It is common for young, newly emerged workers to remain in the nest and tend eggs, larvae and pupae. As the workers age, they may shift their activities away from tending brood and begin to undertake nest construction and excavation. Finally, later in life they may become foragers, leaving the nest to search for food. In contrast to this, some workers may perform the same activities throughout their lives, or in other cases, all workers may undertake all activities of the colony, performing any given activity for a few days before switching to another. In many dimorphic and polymorphic species, the size of the worker will influence its activities. For example, major workers may only be found in or near their nests while only minor workers forage away from the nest.

This cooperation and division of labour, combined with their well-developed communication systems, has allowed ants to utilise their environment in ways approached by few other animals.	

Majors and Soldiers (workers)
These are the largest-sized infertile individuals in a colony. Polymorphic workers (same growth rules but small and large individuals differ in shape due to allometry) are distinct from soldiers having morphological traits absent in workers. In Cataglyphis bombycina and various Colobopsis, workers vary extensively in body size, but the majors are morphologically distinct from the soldier caste.
In other words, major worker ants are distinct from soldiers.

Morphological sense of Soldiers
Characterised by physical traits absent in (minor) workers, soldiers are a mosaic of queen-like and worker-like traits, and can be considered as a third caste, not a sub-caste of workers. Heads are usually enlarged because of powerful mandible muscles, and mandibles can have specialised shapes (for seed-milling, wood-boring, or defence). In various unrelated genera, the head is modified to be door-shaped. The prothorax is enlarged in many species due to larger neck muscles needed to carry heavy heads.

Functional sense of Soldiers 
Workers that perform the task of colony defense; workers with the same morphology can show defensive behaviors in some species (logically should be called "soldier") while in other species similar workers specialize in crushing seeds or storing food in the gaster

Repletes (workers)
Workers or soldiers whose crop is greatly distended with liquid food and functioning as living reservoirs; this food is shared with other colony members by regurgitation

Gamergates (workers)
Mated, egg-laying workers that reproduce sexually, like the queen caste. In about 1% of species, across several ant subfamilies, all workers in a colony can mate and store sperm in the spermatheca. Dominance interactions regulate which individual(s) can mate and lay eggs.

Males (aner):
Fully winged males
The vast majority of species have fully-winged males. Ant males are optimized for flight and are highly effective agents of dispersal.
Non-flying males
A very small number of ant species have wingless or short-winged males. Consequent to the lack of wing muscles, the thorax is reduced in volume and sclerites fuse in some species. Hence “ergatoid” (worker-like) is appropriate to describe such males.


Brood:
Antkeepers/ From egg to ant
https://www.antkeepers.com/facts/ants/egg-to-ant/
Ants undergo complete metamorphosis, passing through a sequence of four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. brood (eggs, larvae and pupae)
There are three phases that every ant goes through before it can be considered complete and ready to start it’s service to the colony. The queen is the mother of all colony members, and for the most part lays all of the eggs. The time from egg to ant is not the same in every species, but a well-known example is the black garden ant (Lasius niger) which takes approximately eight weeks to finish the process.
The development is divided into three stages. The first stage is the egg, followed by the larvae which is in turn followed by the pupae.

The egg:
The eggs are tiny. They have an oval form with a sticky surface. The stickiness serves as glue when several eggs are put together, making it easier for the workers to carry many eggs at a time. This is very practical and crucial in times of nest invasion when brood needs to be transported to safety as quickly as possible.

The queen is also able to lay trophic eggs. These eggs are made for eating and are not fertilised. It might seem an odd thing, but they are actually quite useful. For example, when the queen is founding her colony, she is unable to go out foraging. She then converts her wing muscles into eggs, which she can eat and get nutrients from. They are also great for feeding the larvae when no other food is around. In some cases, workers have been known to lay trophic eggs and feed them to the queen. 

The larvae:
When the egg is ready, it will slowly transform into a larva. They are, just like the egg, white but differ from it in length. The larvae is transparent, long and shaped like bananas. They are equipped with small hairs serving the same functions as the glue of the eggs. Thanks to the hairs they can be attached to each other, walls or floors. Their mobility is certainly restricted, but they can move their head to turn their mouth towards food. (2)

Larvae are for the most part being held near the eggs. They form piles where the larvae might accidentally eat some of the fertilised eggs. The larval stage consists of four stages, during which the workers feed them with liquids. They need a lot of protein to be able to grow into the body of an adult ant. Some ant species feed their larvae with solid food which they have chopped into small parts to make it easier to consume. The larvae is also known to emit liquids – some sort of feces – that the workers either consume or throw away. One of these is floury and seem to be very attractive to the workers, which gathers around to taste it. If not floury, the liquid is transparent and seem not to interest the ants, which throws it away outside of the colony. (3)

The pupae:
The third and last stage of an ant’s development is the pupae. During the end of the larval stage (pre-pupae) the larvae becomes inactive and gets rid of the poisons they’ve collected during that stage. This forms a black dot, visible to the human eye. Some ant species have larvae that spins cocoons, while others don’t. The pupae starts out white, as the larvae, but darkens over time.

From egg to ant
When the pupae is fully grown and has begun to darken, it will wake up. For the first days of it’s life it will be lightly coloured and transparent in comparison to the other members of the ant colony. But after a few days it will darken and gain the same markings as it’s sisters. Most ant species let the new ants (also called nanitics) live their first time in safety, tending to the eggs, queen and other inside-duties of the colony. Then eventually they will look towards more dangerous tasks such as foraging or defending the nest. The closer one ant is to death (by age), the more economically motivated the colony is to risk it’s life.

Ant Life Cycle - Ask A Biologist:
https://askabiologist.asu.edu/individual-life-cycle#:~:text=Ants%20undergo%20complete%20metamorphosis%2C%20passing,life%20begins%20as%20an%20egg.
An ant’s life begins as an egg. Ant eggs are soft, oval, and tiny – about the size of a period at the end of a sentence. Not all eggs are destined to become adults – some are eaten by nestmates for extra nourishment.

An egg hatches into a worm-shaped larva with no eyes or legs. Larvae are eating machines that rely on adults to provide a constant supply of food. As a result, they grow rapidly, molting between sizes.
When a larva is large enough, it metamorphoses into a pupa. This is a stage of rest and reorganization. Pupae look more like adults, but their legs and antennae are folded against their bodies. They start out whitish and gradually become darker. The pupae of some species spin a cocoon for protection, while others remain uncovered, or naked.

Finally, the pupa emerges as an adult. Young adults are often lighter in color, but darken as they age. The process of development from egg to adult can take from several weeks to months, depending on the species and the environment. Did you know that ants, like all insects, are full-grown when they become adults? Their exoskeletons prevent them from getting any larger.



The Ant Life Cycle
After nuptial flight
Either during her search or once a suitable site is found she bites off her wings as they are no longer needed. She then seals herself into a small chamber or other secluded place and lays a small batch of eggs. The queen remains in the nest with her brood while it develops, feeding the growing larvae special trophic (unfertilised) eggs which she lays specifically as food for them. These first workers (called nanitics) are often much smaller than subsequent workers as the queen can only provide a limited amount of food compared to that which foraging workers can provide. Once these initial workers mature, they leave the nest and begin to forage, returning captured prey to the queen and her additional brood.

The colony grows as more workers mature, these new workers taking over the care of brood as well as bringing in additional food. At this stage, the queen reduces her activities to egg laying and the workers assume all other tasks in the nest. The queen is still essential for normal colony life, however, as the chemical messages she produces controls the activities of all workers in the nest.

As the colony reaches maturity, it begins to produce the queens and males (called alates) which will form the next generation. Numerous factors determine when queens are produced, including the time of year, the food available to the growing larvae, the size and contents of the egg laid, pheromones or hormones produced by the queen and the age of the queen.

Duration of Ant Metamorphosis:
https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/ant-life-cycle/
Ants undergo a metamorphosis in four life stages: egg, larvae, pupae and adult. The entire process can take up to 60 days from start to finish.
Egg stage: Each ant begins its life cycle as an egg. The colony's queen lays the ant eggs, which typically hatch within one to two weeks of being laid.
Larvae stage: A single larva grows so rapidly that it molts (sheds its skin) several times during this phase, which lasts between 6 and 12 days. (7-14 days)
Pupae stage: In this third and final gestation period (six to 10 weeks) the pupae of some species spin protective cocoons, while others remain uncovered.

Ant life cycle:
https://www.rentokil.co.id/en/ants/ant-life-cycle/
Generally, ant eggs will hatch and eventually reaching into the larval stage within 7 - 14 days depending on species, temperature and humidity.

Ants pupae are white in colour, appear somewhat like adults ants with their legs and antennae folded by the body and covered by a white or brownish cocoon. The pupa emerges as an ant adult within 9 - 30 days in most species.

Caste determination:
Caste In Ant Colonies: How Fate Is Determined Between Workers And Queens
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081021093944.htm
Larvae become different castes (small workers, large workers, or new queens) based largely on the nutrition they receive. Those fed more insects than seeds are more likely to become larger individuals (queen>large worker>small worker). However, genetic differences also contribute and bias the larva's developmental pathway. Even once caste is determined, nutritional, social (colony size), and genetic factors all contribute, but in different ways, to how big an individual grows.

Caste development and evolution in ants: it's all about size
Waring Trible , Daniel J. C. Kronauer	
https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.145292

High nutrition during larval growth in ants can induce queen development, and starvation can prevent it (Brian, 1956, 1979). However, high nutrition during larval growth does not necessarily result in large adult size, as variation in developmental timing (which can result from genetic and other factors) can cause individuals under poor nutritional conditions to prolong development and attain large size, or individuals under rich nutritional conditions to truncate development and attain small size

Two endocrine hormones, juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysone, are important regulators of developmental timing in insects. Pupation (and the cessation of larval growth) is triggered by ecdysone, and the action of ecdysone is inhibited by JH (Hiruma and Kaneko, 2013). Thus, treatment of larvae with JH or JH analogs leads to prolonged growth and larger size, as long as necessary nutrition is present. JH removal and/or ecdysone treatment leads to premature pupation and smaller adult size (Hiruma and Kaneko, 2013). This endocrine regulation of insect size has been demonstrated in Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, and is also supported by experiments in ants. JH treatment in Harpegnathos saltator and M. rubra, for example, prolongs larval development, allowing increased feeding (Brian, 1974; Penick et al., 2012). This in turn translates to larger size at pupation and queen development (Brian, 1974; Penick et al., 2012). In M. rubra, it has been further shown that ecdysone treatment has little effect while JH is present, but leads to premature pupation later in development after JH has been cleared (Brian, 1974). This demonstrates that nutrition and the endocrine system are important regulators of size and caste in ants.

Division of labor within the worker caste appears to be size based. Smaller minimums or minors and medias serve as foragers, care for brood, and attend to nest maintenance whereas majors serve in colony defense, as protein foragers, and as intermediate transporters or “tankers” of carbohydrates from the smaller foragers or “aphid tenders” to the nest (Pricer 1908, Fowler and Roberts 1980, Tilles and Wood 1986). Hölldobler and Wilson (1990) found that labor partitioning may not be solely determined by morphology, but also by age, termed temporal polyethism. Buckingham (1911) and Lee (1938) noted in several species of Camponotus, the youngest ants were 19 nurses, slightly older ants were queen attendants, middle-aged workers were foragers and maintained the nest while the oldest ants served as foragers, nest builders, soldiers and transporters during emigration (Fowler and Roberts 1980). Traniello (1977) observed in C. pennsylvanicus colonies that 68% of all foraging was performed by older workers.
