# CCC-projects-portfolio

This portfolio consists of various projects that I developed during my studies at Corning Community College;
where I obtained my Associate's Degree, majoring in Computer Science (Spring 2021 to Fall 2022).

Many of theses projects where short tasks developed in a week span.

The files are all organized by course number and name. Each subdirectory contains a README file with a description of its contents.
