# Most commands were executed directly @lab46, unless otherwise specified.
# Too obvious or repetitive commands will not have descriptive comments.

00. $ cd /var/public/spring2022/unix/pbx0/abarbcal
# Navigated to assigned directory inside the public directory.
01. $ cp start.html ~/src/spring2022/pbx0
# Copied start.html file to my personal pbx0 directory at home.
# This file already looks suspicious, ".html" huh?
02. $ cd ~/src/spring2022/pbx0
03. $ file start.html
# The following message was returned: 'gzip compressed data, was "lions.in.kenya"'.
04. $ gunzip -v start.html
# The following message was returned: 'unknown suffix -- ignored'.
05. $ gunzip -vf start.html
# Forcing didnt work, got the same message.
06. $ cp start.html lions.in.kenya.gz
# Made a copy of original file just in case. Renamed copy and added suffix gz.
07. $ gunzip -v lions.in.kenya.gz
# Message from gz: replaced with lions.in.kenya.
08. $ file lions.in.kenya
# Message: uuencoded or xxencoded, ASCII text. EZ PZ!
09. $ uudecode lions.in.kenya
# Obtained not.in.norway file.
10. $ cat not.in.norway
# I was not expecting that output. D:
11. $ file not.in.norway
# Message: bzip2 compressed data.
12. $ cp not.in.norway not.in.norway.bz
# I created a separate directory and moved the original not.in.norway file there.
13. $ bunzip2 not.in.norway.bz
# Obtained not.in.norway file.
14. $ file not.in.norway
# Message: POSIX tar archive.
15. $ tar -xf not.in.norway
# Obtained files canyon.mid, sol.exe, & subnet.pka.
16. $ file canyon.mid sol.exe subnet.pka
# Message: canyon.mid: Zip archive data; sol.exe: cpio archive; subnet.pka: uuencoded or xxencoded.
17. $ ./sol.exe
# Didn't work. Had to give it a try, ya know?
18. $ cpio -i sol.exe
# For some reason this command didn't work. I had to do some research regarding this command.
19. $ cpio -i < sol.exe
# Obtained data.file.2; I do not understand why the < symbol makes it work tho.
20. $ unzip canyon.mid
# Obtained a very bright green, almost radioactive, data.file.1.
21. $ uudecode subnet.pka
# Obtained data.file.0.
22. $ file data.file.0 data.file.1 data.file.2
# Message: data.file.0: regular file, no read permission (Really? Just a regular file? How much can I trust that? At this point I trust no one.)
# Message: data.file.1: ASCII text; data.file.2: ZZip archive data.
23. $ cat data.file.1
# Just a plain ASCII text, yeah right. 
24. $ rev data.file.1 > 1
# Of course something is wrong with this file.
25. $ cat 1
# Now its readable.
26. $ chmod 700 data.file.0
27. $ cat data.file.0
# I see whats going on. Gotta use sort.
28. $ file data.file.2
# Smartass file says the data.file.2 is Zzip archive data.
29. $ file -k data.file.2
# 100 hours later, after trying to decompress and extract data.file.2 with one thousand different archive tools, it turns out its just a regular ASCII text file. Yes, you laugh at my misery Matt. I deserve and A++++ for all the trauma this project has caused me...
30. $ rev data.file.2 > 2
31. $ cat 2 | tr -t Z ' ' > data.file.2
# Replaced all misleading Z to just a blank space.
32. $ mv 1 data.file.1
33. $ cat data.file.0 data.file.1 data.file.2 | sort -n > results
# Sorted lines of text from all data.file files in ascending numerical order, and redirected output to file results.
34. $ filechk unix pbx0
# File matched.
35. $ cat results | mail -s "[UNIX: puzzlebox]" wedge abarbcal@lab46.g7n.org
# Took a couple tries, but emailed results as instructed ;)
36. $ submit unix pbx0 results pbx0steps
# This was such a journey, it even had a narrative arch, with data.file.2 being the hidden antagonist; the final boss LOL.
# end of line...
