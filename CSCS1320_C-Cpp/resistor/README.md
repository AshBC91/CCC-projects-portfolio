# Resistor

This code is a C++ program that allows a user to input the colors of a resistor's bands and calculates the resistance value of the resistor based on the standard color codes for resistors. The program defines a class called Resistor which has several member functions: Tens, Ones, Degree, Multiplier, and Resistor. The Tens and Ones functions prompt the user to input the colors of the first two bands of the resistor and assign a corresponding numerical value to the tens and ones member variables of the Resistor object based on the standard color codes for resistors. The Degree function prompts the user to input the color of the third band and assigns a corresponding numerical value to the degree member variable based on the standard color codes. The Multiplier function prompts the user to input the color of the fourth band and assigns a corresponding numerical value to the multiplier member variable based on the standard color codes. The Resistor function calculates the resistance value of the resistor based on the values of the tens, ones, degree, and multiplier member variables and prints the result to the console. The main function creates an object of the Resistor class and calls the Tens, Ones, Degree, and Multiplier functions in sequence, followed by the Resistor function to calculate and print the resistance value of the resistor.
