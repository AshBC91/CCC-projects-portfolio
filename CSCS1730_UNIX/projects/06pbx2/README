=========
Welcome to the next thrilling project in the puzzle box series! As it was
before, a piece of data has been contorted and obfuscated, and requires a
keen, observing eye to suss out, unravel, and piece it back together in a
coherent, vieable form.

Some files in  the zip archive are password protected.  One such password
can  be extracted  automatically from  this document  by grepping  it for
'^PASSWORD:',  and  capturing only  the  content  AFTER  the colon  in  a
variable (that  you can then use  with other commands in  your automation
efforts).

PASSWORD:UYH1sPCoPkVX

Obtain the  password and figure out  how to extract what  data it unlocks
from the archive and investigate it.

Analyze  it;  this  data  is encoded  somehow.  Determine  the  potential
patterns that may  govern it, and explore different ways  of decoding it.
There may  be several  layers, manipulations, pieces,  etc. that  need to
be obtained  and eventully  extracted/decoded/deciphered/arranged/etc. to
build your final result.

Be  careful, exactness  can  matter! Also:  reading  and observation  can
matter.  When you  assume  things,  and don't  check  to  make sure  your
assumptions are in  fact reality, the puzzle box can  snag you, and deter
your progress.

As you go  along, apply your senses of pattern  matching to unjumble what
you have gotten. As always- avoid manual work: use tools on the system to
help you. You  will be again making  a steps file that should  be able to
automate the process, carrying out the non-interactive commands making up
the steps of your solving process. This file shall be called "pbx2steps",
and  you  submit it  at  the  conclusion of  your  work  on the  project,
along  with  the  fully  unravelled  product (stored  in  a  file  called
"pbx2.results").

If you execute this script (your steps file), it should non-interactively
carry out the  unravelling process (assuming the files  have been already
copied into  the current directory),  and produce the end  result without
any errors generated.

Your  steps file  should NOT  incorporate copying  of the  data from  the
public directory, nor  verifying end results, nor  submitting steps. JUST
the  process of  solving the  puzzle  (that way  you don't  have to  make
considerations for whether you are on your  pi or lab46: once you get the
pbx2 project files in place, your steps file can get to work).

In addition to  all the tools we've explored this  semester, you may want
to investigate the following:

  * file(1)
  * xxd(1)
  * cut(1)
  * lzma(1)
  * ls(1)
  * rev(1)
  * xz(1)
  * grep(1)
  * tar(1)
  * sha384sum(1)
  * gzip(1)
  * head(1)
  * uudecode(1)
  * unzip(1)
  * tac(1)
  * tr(1)
  * base64(1)
  * bzip2(1)

Also,  viewing  and reading  through  any  script  logic or  source  code
provided will likely prove invaluable. Always  the aim is to have an idea
of what is going on.

VERIFICATION
============
In the base of the pbx2 project directory (in the unix public directory),
you will find a MANIFEST file.  This contains the sha384sum hashes of the
correctly unscrambled  pieces and resultant  file you are in  pursuit of.
You can generate a sum and grep for  a match in the MANIFEST file to help
ensure whether or not you have got that part.

SUBMISSION
==========
The  unraveled  product (something  visual,  coherent,  and perhaps  some
degree of BEST  CLASS YOU'VE EVER TAKEN greatness) should  be placed in a
file called "pbx2.results",  which, along with "pbx2steps",  are what you
need to submit upon project completion:

    lab46:~/src/SEMESTER/unix/pbx2$ submit unix pbx2 pbx2.results pbx2steps
