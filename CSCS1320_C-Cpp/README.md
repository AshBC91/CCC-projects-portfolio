<p>
I took this class on my third semester during Spring 2022 at CCC, taught by Professor Joseph Oppenheim.<br>
  
We learned the fundamental coding practices for the languages C and C++. We were taught how to use the essential libraries for each language and the difference between a procedural laguange and an object-oriented language.

  <i>I am including only the most relevant projects I developed for this class.</i>
