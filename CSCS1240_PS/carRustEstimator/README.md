# Car Rust Estimator Information

This utility program was intended to calculate how much a car would rust due to salt exposure. The vehicle's salt exposure would depend on how much salt was used on the roads to melt the ice after a snowstorm and how long the user would drive the car in terms of time and distance.

One version of the program asks for user input, and the other version generates random numbers.
