# Brainstorming

1. Have a class called **Formicidae (or Ants)**
2. Have a class called **species**
    - Although there are different subfamilies, genera, and subgenera, I will be skipping straight into species.
    - There are around 14000 different species of ants. For the initial iteration of this program I will be focusing only on one (possibly three) species, but set-up for possible expansion.
    - Depending on the species, the allometry and castes properties vary
3. Have a class called Camponotus pennsylvanicus ( or Black Carpenter)
    - Camponotus polymorphism encompasses four distinct forms of allometry, ranging from monophasic allometry, to complete dimorphism.
    - The most common are monophasic (bimodal) and triphasic. I will be focusing on triphasic.
    - Allometry dictates the different sizes between the castes and subcastes
4. Have a class called **brood**
    - Brood consists of 3 stages (methods), egg, larvae, and pupa
    - Antâ€™s sex and castes are mostly determined by nutrition and genetics.
5. Have a class called **sex**
    - Females are diploid (two sets of chromosomes), hatched from fertilized eggs.
    - Females are haploid (one set of chromosomes), hatched from one unfertilized eggs.
4. Have a class called **castes**
    - Castes depend on how much nutrition a larva receives during development; a starved larvae hatches into workers, very well fed hatches to Queen
    - Depending on nutrition, pupation could be pre-matured or prolonged
    - Worker<Male<Queen
    - Minors<Medias<Majors/Soldiers<Males<Queen
5. Have a class called ** Queen (or gyne)**
6. Have a class called **Workers (or ergates)**
7. Have a class called **Males (or drones)**
    - Males have no roles nor tasks within a colony, their purpose is to reproduce and then die one hour after mating.
