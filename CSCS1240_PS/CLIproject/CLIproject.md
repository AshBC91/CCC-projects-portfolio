# CLI Project (CLIP)

I intended this to be my last project of the semester. What I visualized was to have a collection of all the small utility programs we made throughout the semester into one same master **CLI/terminal program**. However, I was not able to make much progress due to time restrictions.

This program consists of the following commands/utilities/functions:
  - **Welcome message function**: Prints the welcome message once the program is executed.
  - **Convert Temperature**: Converting Celcius to Farenheit and viceversa.
  - **Help command**: Depending on what stage of the program the user is in, the help command will display a help message according to what it is expecting from the user.
  - **Random number generator**: In case the user decides not to input a number themselves, the program generates a semi-random number based on the system time. 
  - **Input selector**: The user may choose if they want to provide a number or have a random number be generated.
  - **Input checker**: Checks if the user provided a valid input or not; loops until it receives a valid input.
